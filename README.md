# atom-gmail
Use Atom to send emails through Gmail or Inbox

Idea:
Get gmail API key to access your own inbox. 
Write in markdown.
Have yaml header that has to: subject: cc: bcc: (from:?) fields
Convert markdown to rendered html (maybe use markdown-here?)
send that rendered output through the API

Should work at least with web-hosted images as well.
